    <h1>Welcome to my webpage, </h1>
    <img src="images/class.jpg" alt="My test image">
    <p>After 7 years working in a finance related job, I decided to change my career and enroll
       full time in a coding bootcamp with DigitalCrafts, hoping to work as a software developer afterwards.
       For the past several years I have observed how prevalent and how advanced information technology
       has become. After reading about it and seeing how it is increasingly impacting every aspect of 
       our economy, I became convinced that this is the future I should pursue. I believe DigitalCrafts
       will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>introduce me into software development</li>
        <li>provide a firm foundation in computer programming</li>
        <li>teach me latest technolgies and languages that build today's websites</li>
        <li>enable collaboration with other student developers</li>
        <li>help me to become job ready</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's a Businessweek <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">
        article</a> that inspired me to pursue career in web development.</p>
